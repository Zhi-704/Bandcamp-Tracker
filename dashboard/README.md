# Dashboard



## üîé Overview

### üìù Description
> This directory focuses on the **dashbooard**. The goal of this directory is to use the data existing on the RDS by querying it to then **display complex visualisations** regarding the data scraped from the Bandcamp API. This results in trends regarding artists, tags and tracks being identified.

### üìã Contents
Below is a list of the different pages on the dashboard:
- `Home` is the default page that users are sent to that shows top tracks and albums.
- `Artists` shows top artists and lets you go more in depth to compare artists with each other and see how they are performing.
- `Locations` shows a map of the world and lets you hover on it to see how popular a country is in terms of purchases being made.
- `Subscriptions` allows users on the dashboard to subscribe to notifications and pdf reports.
- `Tags` shows top tags and lets you go more in depth to compare tags with each other and see how they are performing.

- **Dashboard**
  1. **ECR** service that is used as a container for the scripts required to host the dashboard which contain data that are obtained from querying the database. ECR is used so that the scripts can be hosted on the cloud and therefore this part of the tracker can be execute on the cloud.
  2. **Fargate** is easy to use and set up compared to alternatives which is fantastic for the purpose of the dashboard since we do not need to continuously access the machine, it only needs to host the service. The purpose of the Fargate is that it hosts the dashboard 24/7 so consumers can access Apollo's analytics whenever they want.
  3. **The Public** can access the dashboard whenever they want to find out analytics regarding their favourite artists, tags and tracks.
